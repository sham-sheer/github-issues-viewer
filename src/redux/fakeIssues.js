In just the same way that herd immunity works by most\r\npeople being vaccinated, proliferating knowledge of force-with-lease\r\nshould help nudge people towards using safer git practices in general."

Raise error when `eager_load` with `select` additional attribute. Message should be like \"eager_load is not accept additional attribute with select, use joins or preload instead.\"\r\n2. Make accessible additional attributes.\r\n\r\nThis PR is 2nd approach.\r\n\r\nFor eager_load, it's not sure that 'additional attribute' belongs to which table.\r\nBut I think rails developer often think select attribute should belong to the base class (Post in above example).\r\n\r\nPlease advise me that what kind of approach it should be.\r\n"

The tests with `non_unicode_string` will raise the exception.\r\n\r\nRun https://gist.github.com/alimi/b8071867f4611a54eb9647ac5d0241a4 to verify it works on 5.2.\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nBefore Rails 6, `String#parameterize` and the underlying methods it calls supported non-Unicode strings. Maybe they still should in Rails 6?\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\n\r\n`String#parameterize` and the underlying methods it calls no longer support non-Unicode strings. They now raise `Encoding::CompatibilityError`s.\r\n\r\nIt looks like the change in behavior was introduced in https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/26743. `String#parameterize` eventually calls `ActiveSupport::Unicode::Multibyte#normalize`. `#normalize` [used to do a bunch of stuff](https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/fc5dd0b85189811062c85520fd70de8389b55aeb/activesupport/lib/active_support/multibyte/unicode.rb#L274) and now it's [mostly a wrapper around the native Ruby method](https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/cf608ee34dd833b0357ef4eefa692db33242d2aa/activesupport/lib/active_support/multibyte/unicode.rb#L108).\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n**Rails version**: master\r\n\r\n**Ruby version**: 2.5.0p0\r\n\r\n/cc @eileencodes @rafaelfranca @mtsmfm\r\n"

Upload file via the file input                      \r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\nDirect upload should process like any other file\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\nGet a `422` Unprocessable entity on a subsequent `PUT` request to the ActiveStorage controller. Regular file uploads work and direct uploads work if they are in any other format besides gzipped.\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n**Rails version**: 5.2.1\r\n**Ruby version**: 2.5\r\n"

    "body": "If a connection is connected to the database after boot (for example in\r\ndevelopment, models are not eagerly loaded) the query cache won't be\r\napplied to queries to that model until the second request. On one-hand\r\nthis is _just_ development and test, but query cache is kind of\r\nmysterious and it's a pain to test it on production. I think it's\r\nimportant for it to behave the same in dev/test so that testing is\r\neasier.\r\n\r\nThis is especially important for multiple databases. In a standard\r\napplication this isn't a problem - there's only one connection and it's\r\nconnected on boot. However, in a multiple database application, the\r\nadditional models are connected after boot, on the first request to that\r\ndatabase (lazily). So the first request with multiple queries to that\r\nsecond database won't be cached at all.\r\n\r\nTo fix this scenario we've moved the question of whether the cache\r\nshould be turned on up to the handler. Since the handler will always be\r\nconnected, connections that are added to that handler after boot will\r\nget the cache also.\r\n\r\nThe test here was deleted because it broke. But the broken test wasn't\r\nsomething that was possible in the Real World anyway. The test was\r\nestablishing a connection in one thread and another thread was asking if\r\nthe query cache was on. In an application this would and should break in\r\nunexpected ways.\r\n\r\n[Eileen M. Uchitelle + Aaron Patterson]\r\n\r\ncc/ @matthewd @rafaelfranca @tenderlove "

    "body": "This PR implements the basic API requirements laid out in https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/33877 by DHH. The PR aims to focus only on implementing the `connects_to` and `connected_to` API. For now it does not tackle any configuration changes (we can hash that out in future PRs). If this API is acceptable I will add tests.\r\n\r\ncc/ @dhh @matthewd @rafaelfranca @tenderlove \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis PR adds the ability to 1) connect to multiple databases in a model,\r\nand 2) switch between those connections using a block.\r\n\r\nTo connect a model to a set of databases for writing and reading use\r\nthe following API. This API supersedes `establish_connection`. The\r\n`writing` and `reading` keys represent handler / mode names and\r\n`animals` and `animals_replica` represents the database key to look up\r\nthe configuration hash from.\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nclass AnimalsBase < ApplicationRecord\r\n  connects_to database: { writing: :animals, reading: :animals_replica }\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nInside the application - outside the model declaration - we can switch\r\nconnections with a block call to `connected_to`.\r\n\r\nIf we want to connect to a db that isn't default (ie readonly_slow) we\r\ncan connect like this:\r\n\r\nOutside the model we may want to connect to a new database (one that is\r\nnot in the default writing/reading set) - for example a slow replica for\r\nmaking slow queries. To do this we have the `connected_to` method that\r\ntakes a `database` hash that matches the signature of `connects_to`. The\r\n`connected_to` method also takes a block.\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nModelInPrimary.connected_to(database: { slow_readonly: :primary_replica_slow }) do\r\n  ModelInPrimary.do_something_thats_slow\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor models that are already loaded and connections that are already\r\nconnected, `connected_to` doesn't need to pass in a `database` because\r\nyou may want to run queries against multiple databases using a specific\r\nmode/handler.\r\n\r\nIn this case `connected_to` can take a `handler` and use that to swap on\r\nthe connection passed. This simplies queries - and matches how we do it\r\nin GitHub. Once you're connected to the database you don't need to\r\nre-connect, we assume the connection is in the pool and simply pass the\r\nhandler we'd like to swap on.\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nActiveRecord::Base.connected_to(hander: :reading) do\r\n  Dog.read_something_from_dog\r\n  ModelInPrimary.do_something_from_model_in_primary\r\nend\r\n```"

What might happen is that while one request changes the locale, another using `I18n.locale` directly might get the changed locale instead of the default one - which can be assumed as the value we'll get when we do not change the locale in a request.\r\nI know that because I've seen this [I18n issue](https://github.com/svenfuchs/i18n/issues/381) before.\r\nAn approach that would work is to use `I18n.with_locale`:\r\n```ruby\r\naround_action :switch_locale\r\n\r\ndef switch_locale(&action)\r\n  locale = params[:locale] || I18n.default_locale\r\n\r\n  I18n.with_locale(locale, &action)\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nHe answered that he got this solution straight from the Rails guides, in the following section: https://guides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html#managing-the-locale-across-requests.\r\n\r\nThis might look obvious - a global value is changed, so it will affect other requests too - but it might not be clear to everyone, especially beginners. And since Puma is a very popular choice these days to work with Rails, I decided to open this issue to see if you're willing to accept a patch to change the guides.\r\n\r\n### Sample repository\r\nI created a sample repository where this can easily be tested. The relevant files are https://github.com/tegon/rails-guides-locales-bug/blob/master/config/environments/development.rb#L62, https://github.com/tegon/rails-guides-locales-bug/blob/master/app/controllers/pages_controller.rb and \r\nhttps://github.com/tegon/rails-guides-locales-bug/blob/master/app/controllers/locales_controller.rb\r\n\r\nIf you just want to see it in action, there are some gifs below too:\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n <summary>I18n.locale=</summary>\r\n\r\n![i18-global-puma](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3727827/46304703-ccacd080-c585-11e8-847d-bdfbf27931ad.gif)\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n <summary>I18n.with_locale</summary>\r\n\r\n![i18-with-locale-puma](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3727827/46304714-d2a2b180-c585-11e8-81a6-bf6165e05575.gif)\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n- Clone the repository: https://github.com/tegon/rails-guides-locales-bug\r\n- Run `bin/setup`\r\n- Rails `bin/rails server`\r\n- Fire multiple requests that changes `I18n.locale`: `for i in `seq 100`; do; curl http://localhost:3000/home\\?locale\\=pt-BR; echo \"\"; done`\r\n- Fire multiple requests to show the value of `I18n.locale`: `for i in `seq 100`; do; curl http://localhost:3000/locale ; echo \"\"; done`\r\n- Check whether the values of the second requests show some `pt-BR` between the `en` values\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n**Rails version**: 5.2.1\r\n\r\n**Ruby version**: 2.5.0\r\n\r\n### Proposed solution\r\nThe way I see it we could either:\r\n- Change the docs to use the `I18n.with_locale` with an `around_action`\r\n- Keep the current example and add notes to warn that it might leak the local in multi-threaded environments, alongside the `I18n.with_locale` example.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know your thoughts on it. I will be happy to send a pull request for this if you agree with this. Thanks!"

    "body": "In Basecamp, we use Rack middleware to extract an account ID from the leading segment of each request's path and move it to `env['SCRIPT_NAME']`. This causes Rails to prefix every generated path with the account ID, freeing us from having to pass it as an argument at every call site for every URL helper.\r\n\r\nHere’s a simplified example of such a middleware class:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nclass SlugExtractor\r\n  def initialize(app)\r\n    @app = app\r\n  end\r\n\r\n  def call(env)\r\n    request = ActionDispatch::Request.new(env)\r\n\r\n    # If the first path segment is an integer, pull it off of path_info and put it in script_name.\r\n    if request.path_info =~ /\\A(\\/(\\d+))/\r\n      request.script_name = $1\r\n      request.path_info   = $'.empty? ? '/' : $'\r\n    end\r\n\r\n    @app.call(env)\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nURL helpers for isolated Rails engines disregard `env['SCRIPT_NAME']` when it’s populated by middleware like `SlugExtractor`. If `SlugExtractor` sets `env['SCRIPT_NAME']` to `\"/8675309\"`, the following erroneously generates `\"/google_sign_in/authorization\"` instead of `\"/8675309/google_sign_in/authorization\"` (assuming [`GoogleSignIn::Engine`](https://github.com/basecamp/google_sign_in) is mounted at `/google_sign_in`):\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\ngoogle_sign_in.authorization_path\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen the code below is reached, it appears that `options[:script_name]` is incorrectly `nil`. As a result, it’s set to `\"/google_sign_in\"` instead of `\"/8675309/google_sign_in\"`:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/rails/rails/blob/9fa4342970e2c8ac24bcc595f120ab65e88095a4/actionpack/lib/action_dispatch/routing/routes_proxy.rb#L38-L41\r\n\r\nFor a failing test case, see [this gist](https://gist.github.com/georgeclaghorn/d362d442ab2149f84939e2f65945afd0)."
